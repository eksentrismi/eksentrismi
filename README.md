    👋 Hi, I’m Ronja. Also going by my nickname "Roni" online. I'm a 24 years old student from Finland.
    👀 I’m interested in visual arts, 3D modeling, collecting retro things & old tech.
    🌱 I’m currently learning IT & software development in a vocational school. 
    💿 My favorite languages so far: HTML, CSS
    📟 Languages I'm still studying/learning: C++, C#, SQL, Javascript
    ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite drink is Pepsi Max... I can't even count how many liters of it I consume during a week, lol.
