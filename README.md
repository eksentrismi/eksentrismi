    ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eksentrismi. I'm a 23 years old student from Finland.
    ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in visual arts, 3D modeling, collecting retro things & old tech.
    ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning IT & software development in a vocational school. I'm still a beginner, so my codes might not be the most logical or cleanest things ever. 
    ğŸ’¿ My favorite languages so far: HTML, CSS
    ğŸ“Ÿ Languages I'm still studying/learning: C++, C# (there will be more later, as time goes on!)
    ğŸ“« How to reach me: either on Tumblr, BlueSky or Instagram (my username is eksentrismi in all those ones too!)
    ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Any!
    âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite drink is Pepsi Max... I can't even count how many liters of it I consume during a week, lol.
